  <h1>Prague</h1>
<h2>Places to go</h2>
    <ul>
  	<li>Charles Bridge</li>
  	<li>Old Town Square</li>
  	<li>Prague Castle</li>
  	<li>Museum of Communism (there are 2, both are worth a visit)</li>
  	<li>John Lennon Wall</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Transport</h2>
  <p> The metro system in Prague is very simple and relatively easy to understand. The main problem was, however, was that there was only a small number of stops, so we found that we would have to walk for quite a while to get to our desired destination. 
Nevertheless, tickets are quite cheap (as is everything else in Prague!)
Prices of trains, buses and trams for adults, seniors & students:	
Single Ticket for 90 minutes travel - 32czk
Single Ticket for 30 minutes travel - 24czk
1-Day Pass (24 hours) - 110czk
3-Day Pass (72 hours) - 310czk	
</p>
  <h2>Student Hacks</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Don’t go to the largest nightclub, Karlovy lazne, because it’s very overrated (unless you are there at the weekend). Instead take a stroll up to Letna Beer Gardens overlooking the city at night (crack open a cold one with the lads/ladies).</li>
	<li>Go on a free walking tour! These can be found in most European cities, but be sure to book them online at least a week in advance, especially during peak season. Prague is a great place to try this as there is so much to see and the tour guides are very knowledgeable and friendly, making the tours thoroughly enjoyable. Useful tour sites include 
		<ul>
			<li>Sandeman tours </li>
			<li>Freetours.com</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Paying to rent a pedal boat for an hour is well worth the money. You’ll get to ride it around the Charles Bridge area and if you time your excursion well, you can catch a magnificent view of the sun setting over the Prague castle. </li>
	<li>DO NOT pay to go the Old New Synagogue, ( supposedly the oldest synagogue in Europe) - NOT WORTH IT - either get the ticket for all of the synagogues, or just go to the Jubilee Synagogue, (the pretty one).</li>
	
</ul>
