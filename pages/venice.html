  <h2>Transport</h2>
  <p>
  	For Venice, we’d highly recommend staying somewhere ON the island as travelling to and from can prove a nightmare. 
However, if you do decide to stay away from the island, (we stayed in a place called Vigodarzere), the train trips are covered by your interrail pass. The main downsides are the long journeys (for us, it took at least 1 hour), the potential train changes, and the time for the last train is usually quite early.
*TIP*: get the interrail app (for iOS and Android) to check train times in advance!

  <h2>Student Hacks</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Getting lost in the never ending labyrinth of winding passageways can be the best way to explore Venice. Despite encountering many a dead-end you will find some enchanting quiet corners that will be well worth the wait.</li>
	<li>Another once-in-a-lifetime experience is enjoying a ride on a gondola, however the standard €80 for 6 people is pretty pricey on a tight budget. If missing out on the gondola ride gives you FOMO (fear of missing out), we recommend the mini 5 minute version, which is called a ‘treghetto.’ For €2 a ride, you have time to take some instagram-worthy photos, sit back and enjoy crossing a main canal in the sunshine and enjoy the banter of sharing a boat-ride with a bunch of fellow cheapskate travellers.</li>
	<li>Try asking locals (for example, those that run the local grocery stores/ less touristy shops) for food recommendations instead of asking your tour guide- but this really depends on the type of tour you’re on and what kind of guide you have.</li>
</ul>
