  <h2>Transport</h2>
  <p>Getting around Berlin is easy! The S-Bahn can take you anywhere in central Berlin, and at a reasonable price. 

There are 3 different zones: A, B and C and the price varies according to which zone you want to go to. 

If you’re aged between 6 to 14, you are eligible for the reduced price. 

**Once you get your ticket, you have to VALIDATE IT, BUT there are no barriers when you go on the train. HOWEVER, if you are caught without a ticket, you will get fined up to €200! 

(The inspectors have been known not to wear a uniform so BEWARE!!!)
