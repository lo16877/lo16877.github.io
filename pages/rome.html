  <h2>Student Hacks</h2>
<ul>
	<li>If you fancy a break from the bustling city, return train tickets to the beach can be bought for little over €5. Pack a picnic, a book and swimwear to complete your relaxation.</li>
	<li>UBER IS ILLEGAL SO MAKE SURE TO GET SOMEONE WHO SPEAKS ITALIAN TO HELP YOU BOOK A TAXI OR YOU MIGHT GET STRANDED, ESPECIALLY SO IF YOU HAVE AN EARLY FLIGHT.</li>
	<li>The Villa Borghese gardens are free to enter and there are always various activities going on, including a modern art museum in the garden complex that is well worth a visit. There are also beautiful views of the sunset from several lookout points as well as a replica of Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre.</li>
</ul>
